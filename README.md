# Form with a sliding button

This react app is a single form with a button that slide when trying to submit if the form is not completed.

The single dependency I've used here is called `styled-components`. I used it to help me with the css animations and transform properties.
This library allowed me to add props in my CSS atributes.

This app is made of the main page `App.js` and a reusable component `SlidingButton.js`.

The form is completed when something have been written in the mail and in the password input. When the form is completed the Button goes green and can be clicked. Otherwise the button will escape your cursor.
