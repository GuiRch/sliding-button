# Form with a sliding button

This react app is a single form with a button that slide when trying to submit if the form is not completed.

The single dependency used here is called `styled-components`. I used it to help me with the css animations and transform properties.
This librairie allowed me to add props in my CSS atributes.

This app is made of the main page `App.js` and a reusable component `SlidingButton.js`.
